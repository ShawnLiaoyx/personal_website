Good filtering systems avoid two common traps: hidden state and unclear scope.

## Rule 1: Keep URL state explicit

If users can share a filtered result, the URL should reflect it. This also makes QA easier.

## Rule 2: Prioritize the first decision

Give one obvious path first, then advanced controls. People often leave when the filter panel looks like a form builder.

## Rule 3: Count results early

Small details like visible result counts significantly improve trust.

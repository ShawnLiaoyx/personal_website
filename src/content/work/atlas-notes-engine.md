Atlas Notes Engine gives writers an ergonomic authoring workflow without introducing heavy backend maintenance. I implemented schema-safe frontmatter validation and automatic summaries for better discoverability.

## Highlights

- Rich text input through MDX with markdown fallback.
- Validation at build-time to avoid broken content.
- Quick publishing flow by committing markdown files.

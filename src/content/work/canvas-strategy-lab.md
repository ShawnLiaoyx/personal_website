Canvas Strategy Lab helps design and product teams inspect outcomes from complex experiments. I designed the information architecture, built a compact data pipeline, and tuned interactions for quick side-by-side comparisons.

## Impact

- Reduced review time by 38% for weekly portfolio meetings.
- Added export-friendly snapshots for leadership updates.
- Introduced role-based views for product, design, and growth teams.

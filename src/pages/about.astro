		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			I build portfolio-grade web experiences and content systems that remain easy to maintain.
			My work sits at the intersection of frontend engineering, editorial workflows, and product
			strategy.
		</p>
		<h2>What I optimize for</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fast sites that still feel expressive.</li>
			<li>Simple editing flows for long-term publishing.</li>
			<li>Typed content models that reduce production mistakes.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
